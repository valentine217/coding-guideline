# Coding style

## Abstract
In order to keep our code clean, readable and maintainable, we established several guidelines.
The concerned languages are the following :

- [HIVE](./bash.md)
- [Python](./python.md)
- [Bash](./bash.md)

These guidelines are subject to evolution and improvement and more languages should be documented as well, so make sure to check the documentation frequently.

## Linters
In order to ease respecting the coding style Linters are often used. Each language have its associated linter :
- python : [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)

These linters come with their associated configuration file, that can be found [here](./linters_configuration)

These files, as well as the coding style guidelines, are subject to changes, according to the standard's evolution and discussions within the team, please make sure to regularly update your linters configuration files.
